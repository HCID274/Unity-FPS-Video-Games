# Unity-FPS-Video-Games

This is a First-Person Shooter (FPS) game developed on the Unity 3D platform. This project delves into the design and development process of FPS games, including character control, level design, shooting design, and enemy AI design. Additionally, we focus on the design of animation and special effects in the UI, offering an in-depth interpretation of the core techniques for creating, transitioning, and implementing UI animations and effects.

Specifically, we provide an exhaustive analysis of the AI pathfinding mechanism for enemies, illustrating its application in complex 3D game environments with examples. We summarize the achievements made in our practical research, discuss the challenges encountered during development, and contemplate potential future research directions. The appendix section of the project provides detailed code implementation and game design documents for other game developers to reference.

By combining theory and practice, this project provides a robust guide for game design and development. It not only assists game developers in more effective game design and development, but also offers valuable insights to enhance the player experience in games.
